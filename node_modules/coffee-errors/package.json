[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) has built in support for this, but it only works when the script is executed through the `coffee` command. If you are running mocha, node-dev, jasmine or any other method, the functionality isn't on.\n\nThis is a pretty much straight copy of the original source, except it doesn't compile the source maps until necessary therefore speeding up the initial bootup process.\n\nThe package reuses expects you to have `coffee-script` already installed in your project.\n\n[![Dependency status](https://david-dm.org/alexgorbatchev/coffee-errors.png)](https://david-dm.org/alexgorbatchev/coffee-errors)\n[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/alexgorbatchev/coffee-errors/dev-status.png)](https://david-dm.org/alexgorbatchev/coffee-errors#info=devDependencies)\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/alexgorbatchev/coffee-errors.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexgorbatchev/coffee-errors)\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/coffee-errors.png?downloads=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/coffee-errors)\n\n## Support\n\nPlease help me spend more time developing and maintaining awesome modules like this by donating!\n\nThe absolute best thing to do is to sign up with [Gittip](http://gittip.com) if you haven't already and donate just $1 a week.
